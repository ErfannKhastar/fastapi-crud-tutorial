    Casts or removes a vote on a post for the authenticated user.

    The direction of the vote is controlled by the `dir` field in the request body:
    - `dir = 1`: Add a vote (upvote).
    - `dir = 0`: Remove a vote (downvote).

    A user cannot vote on the same post more than once.

    Args:
        vote (schemas.Vote): The request body containing the post_id and vote direction.
        db (Session): The database session dependency.
        current_user (models.User): The authenticated user making the request.

    Raises:
        HTTPException(404): If the post to be voted on does not exist.
        HTTPException(409): If the user tries to add a vote to a post they have already voted on.
        HTTPException(404): If the user tries to remove a vote that does not exist.
