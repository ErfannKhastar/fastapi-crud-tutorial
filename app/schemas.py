"""
Defines the Pydantic models (schemas) for the application.

These schemas are used for:
1.  Data validation for incoming request bodies.
2.  Data serialization for outgoing responses.
3.  Generating the OpenAPI (Swagger UI) documentation.

Separating schemas from the database models provides a clear and secure API layer.
