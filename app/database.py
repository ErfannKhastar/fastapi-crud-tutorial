"""
Handles all database connection and session management using SQLAlchemy.

This module defines the necessary components to connect to the PostgreSQL database,
create sessions for transactions, and provide a declarative base for the models.
It includes the `get_db` dependency, which is used across the application
to inject a database session into path operation functions.
